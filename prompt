Create NodeJS http service, using TypeScript and express.js library
Service must have initializer for SQLite database with two defined tables, User and Joke.
User table must have id (auto-increment), username, and password fields.
Table Joke must be related to table User (by user_id foreing key), and have fields id (taken from JSON response of API desribed below), joke_content, and user_id (foreign-key, pointing to user that made a request).
Service must have login and logout endpoints, and a GET HTTP endpoint that on every request returns a joke generated by https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random public API, the structure of response is this: {
"icon_url" : "https://assets.chucknorris.host/img/avatar/chuck-norris.png",
"id" : "PPpterkDSWy52P6a-MisVg",
"url" : "",
"value" : "The only thing that makes Chuck Norris fall asleep is the sound of his own laughter after he kills a kids family making them orphans."
}. Value field of JSON should get saved to datatabase, in field joke_content, and have id taken from this response. It should also put id of logged in user that made this request in user_id field. This endpoint should only be accessible to logged in user (use authorization token header made by library of your choice for authorization mechanism)
